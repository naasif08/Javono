# Javono

**Javono â€” Java on Native Embedded Operation**

Javono (currently under development) is a lightweight toolchain that lets you write embedded firmware for microcontrollers using familiar Java syntax. It follows the intuitive setup() and loop() structure, inspired by the Arduino programming model.

Javono converts a restricted subset of Java into efficient C code suitable for bare-metal environments, without relying on a JVM. The current target is the ESP32 (ESP-WROOM-32).
## Features

- Write Java code with `setup()` and `loop()` methods  
- Support for multiple embedded platforms  
- Simple and extensible framework  
- Efficient Java-to-C integration under the hood
